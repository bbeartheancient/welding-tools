# Welding & Measuring Trainer

Timer-free classroom reimplementation of rulergame.net games (Tape Measure, Dial Caliper) plus an AWS welding-symbol trainer. No timer, no sound — focus on understanding, not speed.

## How to Open

Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). No server required — it works from `file://`. You can also serve it with any HTTP server:

```bash
cd apps/measuring
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

## Three Modules

**Tape Measure** — Read measurements from a tape. Choose the precision (1/8", 1/16", 1/32", etc.), ruler length, and answer format (fractions or decimals).

**Dial Caliper** — Read a dial caliper. Choose inch or metric units, resolution (0.001", 1/64", etc.), and mode (type, find, or trainer).

**Welding Symbols** — AWS A2.4 welding symbols. Three quiz modes: Identify (name a highlighted part), Read (interpret a symbol), and Build (construct a symbol from a spec).

## Settings

Each module has its own settings panel (gear icon). Settings are saved to your browser's localStorage automatically — your preferences persist between sessions.

**Tape settings:**
- Question precision: which fractions to ask about (1", 1/2", 1/4", 1/8", 1/16", 1/32", 1/64")
- Mark precision: which ticks to draw on the ruler (must be ≥ question precision)
- Ruler length: 6" or 12"
- Notation: accept fractions or decimals
- Fraction style: reduced (1/2") or unsimplified (2/4")
- Mode: Type (read a position) or Find (locate a value)

**Caliper settings:**
- Unit: inch or metric
- Resolution: 0.001", 1/8", 1/16", 1/32", 1/64" (inch) or 0.1mm, 0.01mm (metric)
- Mode: Type, Find, or Trainer
- Auto-dial: dial auto-advances as you move the jaw (caliper realism)
- Fine adjust: 0.001" (inch) or 0.01mm (metric) step

**Welding settings:**
- Quiz mode: Identify, Read, or Build

## Scoring

- Points scale with level: 10 pts at level 1, up to 100 pts at level 10
- Level up after every 10 correct answers
- 3 strikes = game over
- No time limit — take as long as you need

## Correspondence to Original Games

| Original (rulergame.net) | This reimplementation |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| English Ruler Game | Tape Measure tab |
| Dial Caliper Game | Dial Caliper tab |
| N/A | Welding Symbols tab (new) |
| Timer with penalty | **Removed** (timer-free) |
| Sound effects | **Removed** (quiet) |
| Leaderboard | **Removed** (classroom use) |

The gameplay mechanics, settings, scoring, and visual layout closely follow the originals. The key difference: no timer pressure.
